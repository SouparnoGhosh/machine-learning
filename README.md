# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains several machine learning projects, each in its own directory. Here's a brief overview of each project:

## [SLP Project](SLP/)

This is the SLP (Single Layer Perceptron) project. It's a simple implementation of a binary classification using a single layer perceptron. The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. For more details, see the [SLP README](SLP/README.md).

## [MLP Project](MLP/)

This is the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) project. It's an implementation of a multi-layer perceptron for various classification tasks. The project uses a dataset related to pistachio quality and characteristics. For more details, see the [MLP README](MLP/README.md).

## [MLP with Optimizers Project](MLP%20with%20Optimizers/)

This is the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) with Optimizers project. It's an implementation of a multi-layer perceptron for classification tasks, with various optimization algorithms. The project uses the `pistachio.csv` dataset. For more details, see the [MLP with Optimizers README](MLP%20with%20Optimizers/README.md).

## Installation

For each project, you'll need to install the required Python libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

## Usage

To run a project, navigate to its directory and execute the `main.py` script with Python. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    cd <project_directory>
    python main.py

Remember to replace `<project_directory>` with the actual directory name of the project you want to run.# machine-learning
