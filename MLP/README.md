# MLP Project

This is the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) project. It's an implementation of a multi-layer perceptron for various classification tasks.

The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network with multiple layers of nodes, where each node in one layer connects with a certain weight to every node in the following layer. This structure allows the MLP to model complex relationships in data, making it suitable for a variety of machine learning tasks.

## Description

This project is implemented in Python and uses libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for mathematical operations, and matplotlib for data visualization.

The main script is `main.py`, which reads the dataset from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, trains the MLP, and then tests it on the test data. The project includes different datasets, each in its own subdirectory.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the MLP directory.
3. Install the required Python libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the `main.py` script with Python. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
python main.py
```

This will train the MLP and print the accuracy of the model on the test data.

This will train the MLP and print the accuracy of the model on the test data.

## Dataset

`MLP_Pistachios`: Contains data related to pistachio quality and characteristics.
