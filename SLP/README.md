# SLP Project

This is the SLP (Single Layer Perceptron) project. It's a simple implementation of a binary classification using a single layer perceptron.

The Single Layer Perceptron (SLP) is one of the simplest forms of a neural network, primarily used for binary classification problems. It consists of a single neuron with adjustable weights and bias. It uses a linear predictor function combined with a binary step function for activation.

## Description

This project is implemented in Python and uses libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for mathematical operations, and matplotlib for data visualization.

The main script is `main.py`, which reads the dataset from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, trains the SLP, and then tests it on the test data.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the SLP directory.
3. Install the required Python libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Running the Scripts

After installing the necessary libraries, you can run the scripts in the different project directories. Here's how you can do it:

### For the SLP Project

Navigate to the SLP directory and run the `main.py` script:

```bash
cd SLP
python main.py
```

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. The dataset is included in the project files as breast_cancer.csv.
